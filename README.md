Various config files for the Solarized dark high contrast color scheme

The official Solarized color scheme provides for various contrasts by shifting certain values up or down. I prefer the dark high contrast theme as it provides enough additional contrast to reduce eye strain. For more information see here:

You may be able to convert a normal Solarized dark color scheme file to high contrast by using the provided Python script:
    
    python solarized-dark-high-contrast.py solarized-dark-theme-file
